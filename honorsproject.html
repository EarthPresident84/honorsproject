    <h1 class="banner">Ethics In Gaming</h1>
    <p>Gaming ethics has been an issue as long as games have been around. And there have been multiple problems that game developers have been trying to solve for years. Today we will break this complex topic down into three simple topics; the first one will be <span class="access">accessibility</span>, the second one will be <span class="rep">representation</span>, and the final one will be <span class="moneyyy">monetization</span> for games. </p>



    <h2 class="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is a pretty complicated topic with many problems that make it hard to implement into games. Problems such as time restraints, and budget restraints, can make it a hard thing to add for such a small portion of the target audience. Accessibility also has its benefits however, such as expanding the amount of people who can play the game. The video <span class="vidarr">below</span> goes into much better detail on this specific topic.</p>

    <h2 class="representation" >Representation</h2>
    <p>Representation can be a very tricky issue that game developers can often come across. On one hand it can be problematic for a game to subconsciously push a narrative that may not have been intended. A great example of this is how in Call Of Duty MW you play as an American Soldier in a war in the middle-east, even though it may be accidental, it still pushes the subliminal message that arabs are enemies and Americans are friends. However, sometimes this can be unavoidable if the point is to depict something happens, it isn't a responsibolity of the developers to completely change their game, just to be aware on the narrative that can be pushed. </p>

    <h2>Monetization</h2>
    <p class="mimimi">Monetization in video games refers to the various strategies developers use to generate revenue from their games, such as in-game purchases, downloadable content (DLC), and subscription models. While these methods can support ongoing game development and provide players with additional content, they also raise significant ethical dilemmas. One major concern is the impact on game design, as developers might prioritize profit over player experience, creating "pay-to-win" scenarios where success is heavily influenced by the amount of money spent. Additionally, there are worries about targeting vulnerable populations, particularly young players, with psychologically manipulative tactics that encourage excessive spending. These practices can lead to financial strain and addictive behaviors, raising questions about the responsibility of game companies to protect their users. Balancing profit with ethical considerations remains a complex challenge in the gaming industry.</p>
